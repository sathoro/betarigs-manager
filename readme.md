## Betarigs Manager

Created for the [Betarigs API challenge](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=663828.0), the purpose of this is to make it incredibly easy to automate the rental of rigs at Betarigs. You can specify the desired hashing power, cost, and pool information and everything else is done for you.

No database necessary. Just open `EXAMPLE.env.php` and set your Betarigs API key, Coinbase API key, and Coinbase API secret and then rename the file to `.env.php` (the dot before `env` is important!). The Coinbase API key only needs sending permissions.
